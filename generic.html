								<h2>Graduation</h2>
								<p>After I Graduate the Moscrop Secondary School in BC, I spent a year to find what I want to do, and what I can do. At that time, my parents recommended Electrical Engineering for a job, so I decided to get into Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in Alberta(NAIT). </p>
								<p>When I get into the NAIT, everything was new, and enough to drag my attention. However, the meaning of the 'new' become a hardship and overwhelm me. Therefore, my first action was to try to become a member with classmates. Share the knowledge and show good teamwork drag us to success and adapt to new environments. While I was studying at NAIT, Covid-19 made me take online courses, so made me take one more semester because missing practical or field work. That means I do not want to be half-assed on my task. If I start to learn new knowledge, then I will show my passion to perfectly understand that.</p>
								<h2>Projects</h2>
								<p>After I successfully graduated the college and got a diploma, begin to build projects. Among them, my favourite project was the Electrical Work Package which customizes the location of heavy electrical equipment in the given spaces. I loved using AutoCAD, so when I working on this project, spend the time on this software and improved the desgin and drawing skill.</p>
								<p>This project was my final project from NAIT; Examination of the Protection Application of the Overreach of Distance Relay. This project simulates the main cause of the blackout which is distance relay can not protect the fault outside of the protection. Therefore, this project simulates why this relay can not protect and how to make it available to protect from the fault with ETAP software. </p>
								<p>The Arduino Thermometer is a simple project. Using the Arduino controller Board and the DHT11temperature/Humidity Module received and control the data by Arduino software to show up in LCD. </p>
								<p>The Lol level search is a new challenge. Therefore, this website is simple as using Jquery and HTML. Using the Riot API, when the user types the name of the League of Legend name, then request and get API by Jquery and represent the level of the name. However, the Riot API is only valid 24hours, so every single time tries to use the website, have to get an AIP key.</p>
